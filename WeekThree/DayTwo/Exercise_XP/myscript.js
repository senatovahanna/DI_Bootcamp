    5 + "34"
    // 5 is a number and "34" is a string. It should just add it (not math) , put together
    // the answer should be "534"
    5 - "4"
    // My first guess was that it will be NaN because "4" is a string.
    // But then i read that mines can change string to number, so the answer will be 1

    10 % 5
    // The answer will 0.

    5 % 10
    // The answer will 5.

    "Java" + "Script"
    // We have two strings. So the answer will be "JavaScript"

    " " + " "
    // Two strings with space will give us a string with 2 spaces
    // "  " - the answer

    " " + 0
    // Space in string + 0, we have string and number
    // the answer is " 0"

    true + true
    // True has a value 1, so 1+1=2

    true + false
    // True has value of 1, and false has value of 0.
    // 1+0 is 1

    false + true
    // 1 . Math. 0+1

    false - true
    // The answer would be -1, the same, just a math.

    3 - 4
    // it should be -1 . Just a math for two numbers

    "Bob" - "bill"
    // I think it would be a NaN (not a number), because there are 2 strings, and "-" operator is only for numbers
